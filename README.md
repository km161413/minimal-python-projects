# minimal-python-projects
Very simple Python projects just to practice and understand the programming concepts that I learn in a better way
 ## first project
 the first project of these projects is a very simple mad lib story that based on three of the user inputs. I wanted to make it longer but I already got the concepts behind this project so writing more code will not benefit me.
 
 Concepts in this project that I learned:
 - Concatenate
 - Naming variables
 - dealing with the input function (just basic dealing)
